# Ping8
A simple Bash script to monitor the connectivity to a specified IP address (Google DNS 8.8.8.8 by default) by sending ping requests and logging the results. The script logs connectivity issues, successful pings, and every 10 minutes logs a status update showing that everything is running normally, along with the last three successful pings.
